    <p>Hi! My name is Jim Dodd, I am an <strong>interior designer</strong> and I'm here to help you everytime you need
      me to create a classy and cosy environment in
      your own home. When I graduated from Oxford I realised how much I had left to learn. A traditional education had
      given me specialised knowledge but hadn't set me up with the skills needed to succeed in an environment of
      constant change.</p>
    <p>So I set out on a journey to answer the question "What knowledge and skills do I need to thrive in the 21st
      century?"</p>
    <p>And also I replied to my question easily because I have realised that it is not important what you do but how and
      that encouraged me to put my soul in each project. That for, people trust me and want to employee me.</p>
    <p>I have been working a lot and during my work, I learned a lot and also I have to learn more and
      more, but with the experience which I have now I can do for you anything you want.</p>
    <p>I'm a sociable person, I 'm doing my job seriously and calmly. I have never fought with a customer becuase I knew
      what he wanted and how to discuss
      with him.</p>
    <p>If you trust me, you will go far!</p>

        <p>Jim's eye for colors is amazing. He shared several color palette's with my husband and we couldn't decide
          anymore. It was very difficult to choose one for our living room because we liked all. Aditionally, Jim worked
          diligently to find a variety of furniture pieces that would compliment our 1926 period home. Now, we are
          enjoying with our children in a cosy environment.</p>

        <p>There are few words to describe ArchiDodd's designs, I can only describe him as creative, classy and with a
          great sense of spacing, he is simply the best designs. It is nice to work with true professionals with high
          ethics and values.</p>
