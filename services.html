                    and
                    goals and I'll do my best.</p>

                <h3>Schematic Design</h3>
                <p>During this stage I will begin by preparing preliminary design sketches based on your requirements
                    and
                    budget to explore and illustrate possible options. I will review these options with you,
                    pointing out the merits and responding to your input.</p>

                <h3>Design Development</h3>
                <p>This stage refines the agreed upon schematic design for a clearer definition of the scope and quality
                    of
                    the finished project. Further cost projections will determine how closely the design conforms to the
                    budget
                    expectations or what if any adjustments are required.</p>

                <p>When the design concepts have been decided, I prepare working drawings and
                    specifications.
                    These are required to obtain building permits and bids, and to guide the contractor in construction.

                <p>I can advise you on your choice of contractor – usually done by calling for competitive
                    bids.
                    I will help evaluate the bids and select the contractor, and prepare the contract
                    between you
                    and the contractor.</p>

                    construction
                    is proceeding in general accordance with the contract, and that the design, materials, and
                    workmanship meet
